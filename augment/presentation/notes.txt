Hoffman finds the lower bound for chromatic numbers, minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph 
such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, which is what min graph coloring is finding. It does this by doing
complicated math on a graph's adjacent matrix to find its eigenvalues which is handled by the python library NumPy. 

Eigenvalues are mathmatical repersentations of the strength of the patterns of connected vertices. It takes the max, representing 
the general strength of the connectivity in the graph, and the min, representing vertices forced apart by edges and cannot share a color, 
eigenvalues and divides them. It then takes 1 and subtracts the quotient to account for even completly disconnected graphs still needing one color.

So since these are mathmaical repersentations of the graph based on spectral graph theory this fromula produces a number that 
is either less than or equal to the graph's chromatic number.
