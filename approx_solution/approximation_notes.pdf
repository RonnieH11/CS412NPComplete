1. Strategy:
    

2. Analytical Runtime:
    When the approximation algorithm runs, it goes through
    each vertex. For each vertex, it checks all of that vertex's
    neighbors and assigns the vertex the minimum color that isn't
    used by its neighbors. Looping through each vertex is O(V),
    checking a vertex's neighbors and assigning the minimum color
    relative to its neighbors each take degree of V steps.
    We know that the sum of degree of V for all vertices is 2E,
    so the total analytical runtime is O(V + E) which runs in polynomial time.
