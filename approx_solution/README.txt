cs412_mingraphcolor_approx.py takes in a txt file containing the vertice edge connections
and returns the number of colors used and a list of the vertices with their colors.

From inside the approx_solution directory, run: python cs412_mingraphcolor_approx.py < test_cases/test.txt for some input file, "test.txt"

You can also run all of the test cases by going into a Git Bash terminal and running "./run_test_cases.sh" or run the non-optimal test by running "./run_nonopt_cases.sh"
